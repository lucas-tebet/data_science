<sub>*Business Analyst*</sub>

"Without data, you're just another person with an opinion" - W. Edwards Deming

Graduated in Engineering, I worked in companies from different segments, always with a data driven mindset, extracting data to generate relevant analysis for the business and providing insights for better decision making.

Nowadays, I work at banQi, a Via Group fintech, in Business Intelligence area. I create dashboards and develop analysis for the Product and Marketing teams.

Looker, SQL and Python are some of the tools that I mainly use in my daily activities.
